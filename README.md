# Hi, welcome :wave:  #

My name is Filipa and I'm a Software Engineering Master's student at [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT). :computer: :computer_mouse:	

I was born and raised in Braga. :portugal: :round_pushpin:

Technology , science and computers are longtime passions of mine. I have always wanted to study something that would not only 
incorporate these topics but would also provide challenges where I could put my competencies to the test. This is why I decided to become a Software Engineer.
