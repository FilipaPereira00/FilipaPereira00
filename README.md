My name is Filipa and I'm a Software Engineering Master's student at University of Minho. 	:computer: :computer_mouse:	

Technology , science and computers are longtime passions of mine. I have always wanted to study something that would not only 
incorporate these topics but would also provide challenges where I could constantly put my competencies to the test. :muscle:

This is why I decided to become a Software Engineer.

Besides all technical competencies I've developed over the past few years, being a software engineer student improved my communication and leadership skills and taught me how to effectively work under a lot of pressure. 

It is somehow curious that even though technology,innovation and the future are a massive part of my life, I am also very passionate about History. 
I'm always looking forward to educate myself and to deepen my knowledge because I truly believe that the past is an essencial key to better understand the present and to understand ourselves aswell. :books:
